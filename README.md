#Aria .NET SDK

The Aria .NET SDK is a library that provides the easiest and quickest way to use the [Aria](http://www.ariasystems.com/) REST and SOAP web services in your .NET application. The .NET SDK also includes sample UI applications integrated with Aria API calls in REST as well as SOAP so you can leverage your existing investment in .NET development while adding the features needed to support your account holders through the Aria Platform.

##Installation

1. The C# files "AriaBillingComplete", "AriaBillingObjectQuery", "AriaBillingAdminTools" and "RestUtilities.cs" for REST mode of SDK are generated on every release and available in GitHub (under NetSDK\src\AriaRestClient).
2. The C# file "References_admin.cs" for the Admin Tools datatypes for REST mode of SDK are generated on every release and available in GitHub (under NetSDK\src\AriaRestClient).
3. Similarly, the test classes "AriaCompleteTest.cs", "AriaObjectQueryTest.cs" and "AriaAdminToolsTest.cs" are updated in GitHub (under NetSDK\src\AriarestClientTest) on every release. These classes shall be used to understand how to call the respective APIs and how to consume the response
4. The library generation has to be done following the instructions on the [Readme.txt] file included on the NetSDK folder.
5. The library files (AriaWebService.DLL and AriaRestClient.DLL) generated by step 3 will be available inside the "NetSDK\build" folder.
6. Import these DLLs to your own .NET project and call the desired API in REST or SOAP mode by using the corresponding "AriaCompleteTest" class.

## Web app installer
The repository also has two web applications that explains how these SDK libraries can be used in web applications. The usage of it is explained below.

1.	To test FullReg and FreeReg web applications, copy the above generated library files to library/AriaSDK in FreeReg and FullReg solution directory.
2.	Open the solution file in Visual Studio and build it (build the installer project also if any component is modified).
3.	By executing Installer (that resides in all client application folder) host the application in IIS. Please refer the 'Installation guide.doc' for the steps to use the Installer.
4.	Then open the application URL in browser and observe the account registration wizard.

##Usage

       /* Use REST or SOAP's AriaBillingComplete class from respective package */

       public static AriaBillingComplete mService = new AriaBillingComplete(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[ARIA_DISPATCHER_URL]);

       get_client_itemsRequest request = new get_client_itemsRequest
            {
            client_no = ClientNumber,
            auth_key = AuthorizationKey,
            filter_currency_cd = "",
            return_no_cost_items = "",
            filter_item_no = 1
            };

        var response = mService.get_client_items(request);
